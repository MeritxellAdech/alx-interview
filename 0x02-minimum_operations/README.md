# 0x02. Minimum Operations
This directory contains a Python script implementing solution to Minimum Operations problem. This project was created as part of my course requirement at ALX.

## Example
Given a number n=9, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n H characters in the file.

`n = 9`

`H` => **Copy All** => **Paste** => `HH` => **Paste** =>`HHH` => **Copy All** => **Paste** => `HHHHHH` => **Paste** => `HHHHHHHHH`

Number of operations: 6

## How to run
The Python script has been marked as an exectuable and can easily be run using the syntax:

`./filename`
